- The web interface needs its own scratch dir so it can get the LATEST commit
  information.

- A % of completed slots would be nice so that when a job is tryign to catch up
  on a LOT of work due to a large-retest then I can see the percentage...  I'm
  going to need a system to log this every hour.

  - I need the ability to embed CPU metrics.

- A test is only pink if it isn't completed... n
  
- change the web root so that index.html is on /

- We're linking to test-logs that do not exist yet.

- restart the daemon again so that coverage and test aren't working.

- put the test-basic in its own test suite though I don't htink it's taking much time.

- how are we going to purge old tests... I think I need to use OLD_AGE to do this.


- it would be NICE to mark a rev as broken and just skip testing it.

- once ANY of the tests fails it would be nice to just abort testing all the
  other tests on the same rev.  That should probably be the default and then we
  can have some mechanism to force a test.

    - Do we want to test on JDK 1.7 and 1.6 too?
    - What about XFS and ext4?

    - I think the right way to handle this would be to have:

        - 1:1:1:1 (jdk1.6+XFS)
        - 1:1:1:1 (jdk1.6+ext4)
        - 1:1:1:1 (jdk1.7+XFS) 
        - 1:1:1:1 (jdk1.7+ext4)
